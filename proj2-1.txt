1. some solutions have moves that only lead to other possible solutions, so there is no point in strongly solving starting from each different permutation



2. a better algorithm would be to just modify the normal algorithm to check if a certain permutation is a solution



3. you might want to store the moves that led to that point so you can run them reverse to check if they are a solution. however, the solver would then need much more memory requirements
